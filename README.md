# Mermaid Viewer

This is a simple example of rendering a mermaid diagram 
from its definition, and inserting the resulting SVG into
the html page in an element specified. The example also
includes a control panel for panning and zooming that is 
taken from the github markdown rendering code. 

The control panel uses the @primer/css npm package for
the icons and styling similar to the GH production look
and feel. 

## Stack
The stack for this example is Node, Typescript (vanilla)
and Vite. This is my first use of Vite and it was super
easy and I plan to use it again.
