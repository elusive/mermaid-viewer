# Mermaid Viewer

This is a simple example of rendering a mermaid diagram 
from its definition, and inserting the resulting SVG into
the html page in an element specified. The example also
includes a control panel for panning and zooming that is 
taken from the github markdown rendering code. 

The control panel uses the @primer/css npm package for
the icons and styling similar to the GH production look
and feel. 

## Stack
The stack for this example is Node, Typescript (vanilla)
and Vite. This is my first use of Vite and it was super
easy and I plan to use it again.

## References
The pan & zoom controls were adapted from the ones that
appear automatically when you include a mermaid diagram
in your README.md file in a Github repository. [More Info](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams)
